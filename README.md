#Kthulu: Destroyer of Phishers

##What is It?
* Automated url validation (is it alive, is it relvant to what we're looking for, does it redirect?)
* Automated credential dump identification and retrieval (Find stashed creds and return)
* Results automatically parsed out into appropriately named files and packed to zip w/ password

##Why?
 * Because getting hit with a billion shortened urls sucks to go through by hand, not to mention takedowns!
 * Get some extra wins with the located credentials
 * Find out where the creds are being posted to via the automatic html grabbing.
 * Use automatically obtained screenshots to send to hosting services!

##*Note:*
***It's important to use a smart IP address when running this - most bad actors will block big name ip ranges,
and known-individual IPs (they talk to each other about us hehe <3) so perhaps use a mobile IP address, they wouldn't want to 
block their customers would they! in the future I'd like to expeirment with other networking protocols:
* tor
* i2p
* etc
to maintain persistent communication pathways to these clowns.

Much Love, don't fret spilled flavored milk beverages!
