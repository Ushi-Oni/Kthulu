#Kthulu: Destroyer of Phishers

##What is It?
* Automated url validation (is it alive, is it relvant to what we're looking for, does it redirect?)
* Automated credential dump identification and retrieval (Find stashed creds and return)
* Results automatically parsed out into appropriately named files and packed to zip w/ password

##Why?
 * Because getting hit with a billion shortened urls sucks to go through by hand, not to mention takedowns!
 * Get some extra wins with the located credentials
 * Find out where the creds are being posted to via the automatic html grabbing.
 * Use automatically obtained screenshots to send to hosting services!

##*Note:*
***It's important to use a smart IP
